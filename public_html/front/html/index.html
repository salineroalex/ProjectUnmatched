		<h1> Welcome Home, ashen one. Speak thine heart's desire.</h1>
		
		<p> Welcome to the Unmatched fanatic's home page.</p>
		
		<h2> "When the Ashes are two, a flame alighteth."</h2>

		<p>
			Set in the <a href="kingdom.html">Kingdom of Lothric</a>, a bell has rung to signal that the First Flame, 
			responsible for maintaining the Age of Fire, is dying out. As has happened many times before, the coming 
			of the Age of Dark produces the undead: cursed beings that rise after death. The Age of Fire can be 
			prolonged by linking the fire, a ritual in which great lords and heroes sacrifice their souls to rekindle the First Flame.
		</p>
		<p>
			However, <a href="lodric.html">Prince Lothric</a>, the chosen linker for this age, abandoned his duty 
			and chose to watch the flame die from afar. The bell is the last hope for the Age of Fire, resurrecting 
			previous <a href="lordsofcinder.html">Lords of Cinder</a> to attempt to link the fire again; however, 
			all but one Lord shirk their duty.
		</p>
		
		<p>
			The Ashen One, an Undead who failed to become a Lord of Cinder and thus called an Unkindled, 
			rises and must link the fire by returning <a href="lodric.html">Prince Lothric</a> and the 
			defiant Lords of Cinder to their thrones in Firelink Shrine.
		</p>
		
		<h2> "The poor wretched souls... Be they lord or legend, the curse shows no mercy. What a shame." </h2>
